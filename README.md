#ICON-OpenGL 

An attempt to bring [OpenGL ES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES) to the [ICON programming language](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/docs/ipd266.htm).


#Getting Started

Build ICON version 9.5.1: [Building ICON](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v951/build.htm)

Install the loadfuncpp from here: [Carl's Loadfuncpp](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~carl/loadfuncpp.htm)

Remember to set IPATH and FPATH for which the ICON compiler relies on:

    As an example, for my setup:
    $FPATH = /opt/icon/bin
    $IPATH = /opt/icon/bin:/opt/icon/lib/
